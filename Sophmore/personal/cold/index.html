  <h3>Often I call friends back home and tell them I am cold. They say, "You're cold? It went all the
      way down to 65f last nigh, thats COLD!" Well for everyones information it does get really cold
      here. Admitadly not as cold as some places, but at least cold enough to complain about.<h3><br>

  <h3>It doesn't ussually drop below 32f here (it gets close often though), but a few times it has.
      I had to take some pictures as proof. Yes, that is ICE on this car.<h3><br>
