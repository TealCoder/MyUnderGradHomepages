<p><h1>Projects</h1><br>
Below are some of the more interesting projects I have worked on.<br>
Some where I got the idea in my early programming career that real code didn't have
comments, when I learned that this was a misconception I was too lazy to learn how
use comments efectively, so most of my code has no comments.<br>
My zip files keep getting corrupted for some reason so they may not work too well.

<h2>Tyrian</h2><br>
<font size=4 color="ff0000">
 This was the first Java game I programmed, inspired by an
old school video game of the same name.<br>
<font size=4 color="00ff00">
 I had a problem I
did not understand at the time, which was when I gave the repaint
command, it painted too slowly, mostly because I decided to output two 500*300
pixel images. This caused the game to get out of synch with the graphics. So I
decided to solve this problem by calling the repaint command and then having that
call the function that calculated everything for the game. If you are a programmer
you probably can see this problem, it caused an unending recursive loop that
continually slows the game down. I have not bothered to fix this problem yet
and I am not sure if I shouldn't just leave it there the same way I don't correct
the grammatical mistakes I made in the book I wrote in kindergarden. Otherwise
the game is kind of fun, looks pretty good, but involves little strategy and has
no variety.<br>

<h2>Road Kill</h2><br>
<p align=left>
<font size=4 color="ff0000">
In my 11th grade year, the "Explorations in Technology" teacher assigned
 the entire class to come up with a nifty project that included some
 of the concepts from the class. I started to program chess in assembly or basic.
 After writing the 500 lines needed to draw the board and pieces and moving
 on to the 5,000 lines needed to calculate legal moves in both languages, I decided there had
 to be a more fun project I could do. Then, a Gothic kid, who saw my Tyrian
 game, recommended I convert that code to a game inspired by GTA2
 (which the school had banned) where you run people over. We worked together to
 design the game; he added ideas while I refined them to be easy to code. He drew
 some images which I animated and incorporated into the game. Another kid from
 the class told us how he was a web design expert could complete the project
 with a kick ass web page
 with 3D stuff. We agreed and I converted the application into an applet in
 preparation for this page. Then this kid busted out the Yahoo page builder,
 and did not even know how to include an applet in a page (he should have had
 to do another project). So it is still embedded in the temporary testing page
 I made for it. The more easy going half of my
 school loved this game. After a little while I added the subliminal message
 "You are Happy" just for fun.<br>
<font size=4 color="00ff00">
The game suffers the same infinite recursive loop problem as Tyrian. An additional
problem the game suffers from that I did not see because I never programmed applets
before was that it takes time for all the images to download. So the images don't
show up for a few seconds after they are requested, because I didn't know I had to
load them. I haven't and probably won't fix these problems either.<br>
<font size=4 color="ffff00">
Because of the second problem, the game doesn't look too good when viewed on a
webpage across the net, so I packaged it up in a zip archive, this.html
runs the game.<br>

<h2>Space Game: my junior project</h2><br>
<p align=left>
<font size=4 color="ff0000">
Never having done well in English I found that I could get an English credit from
a class called "Senior Project". Although I was a junior I was able to take the class.
Inspired by car's subliminal message (which seemed to work) I wondered if we really
had to fear subliminal messages on our television shows and in our theaters.
Already having deciding to make a game for the project I added three subliminal messages
that would encourage players to circle 'A' to multiple choice questions on a
questionnaire I would give them composed of questions no one should know the answers
to. A control group played the game with no messages added. I told the test takers that
the game was an analysis of strategy in gameplay and strategy on tests to throw them
off. I tried to have the test be double blind but with the deadline to my project
rapidly approaching I was unable to arrange this. Anyway, the test results showed what
my accompanying research showed; messages of this form do not work, the fear stems
from hardly documented studies by few supporters who are trying to sell you
something.<br>
<font size=4 color="00ff00">
I still hadn't figured out that the infinite loop in Tyrian was bad, this game has
that problem too. I was going to make levels and all sorts of other features, but
after the experiment I have not worked on it, so that is why there are so many, blank
buttons.<br>
<font size=4 color="ffff00">
I don't remember what I did with the executable, so you will need Java support
to play it.<br>

<h2>My one Layer Neural Network in C++</h2><br>
<p align=left>
<font size=4 color="ff0000">
I heard there were three main forms of AI; recursion, evolution and neural networks.
The first two I had played with a lot, however the third I had only read about, and I had
read mostly theory at that, so I felt I must program at least a minor neural network to
feel complete in understanding the basics of this field. However, now I learn that there
is also self organization, so I will add another project along that line soon.<br>
<font size=4 color="00ff00">
This program does what I saw a picture of a trivial neural network doing and it took me
a while to figure out how to do it, because theory doesn't help much in actual coding. It was
especially hard to figure out that while my idea of extremely small numbers means 10^-15 or so,
but to authors this means about 10^-1.5. This is a pitiful and trivial example of a neural network, but I am super
proud of it.<br>

Here is the short undocumented source code. No plagiarising.<br>

<h2>Evelutionary tic-tac-toe in C++</h2><br>
<p align=left>
<font size=4 color="ff0000">
This I worked on for a group project for Comp151 but I did all the programming almost
exclusivly, not becuase my team members were lazy, but becuase I did not let them
help with it. I programmed most of it before we planned to begin the project anyway.<br>
My roomate who was also working with me on the project liked the Idea of using AI for
the project theme and talked about a book he was reading in which programers created
evolving checker players. I decided that checkers was too complicated for my first
serious evelutionary algorythm, so I decided on Tic-tac-toe. Having already been taught
the basics of evelutionary algorythms in my high school C++ class taught by John Bartelt,
I was able to quickly assemble a skeleton for the program, but having lost most of the
source from the class, I had trouble with details.
I actually turned it in
with a bug in the program that would not allow it to actually evolve. Some other students
were working on just tic-tac-toe and, to be short, could not do it, so we recieved a good
grade on the project anyway.<br>
<font size=4 color="00ff00">
The program was made so you could type &lt your compiler&gt ttt.cpp.
I think it is set to make a population of 10,000, which should be changed to about
1,000 or less at the bottom of game.h.
At 5,000 it would crash my windows
machine, and at a 1,000,000 my school administrators kicked me off my unix account.
The program can be configured to allow either human, evolved, or perfect recursive
players for both Xs and Os. That can be configured in the uncomented section in ttt.cpp
(evolved versus recursive by default I think).
It is not as good as alot of programs becuase I refused to conform to use premade
algorythms or weighting systems that only looked at part of the board.
It runs pretty slow, so is designed to be started and left running overnight or something
