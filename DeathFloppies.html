<h1>The Death Floppies</h1><br>

<p>So, way back when dinasours romed the earth. We had hard invlexible 3x5 pieces of plastic around 
a magnetic tape, which we called "floppy disks". These were all sorts of problems, for example, any webpage could ask for 'A:'
and your computer would freeze up and go "aehaehaehaehaehehehuah!". They stored a couple "large" pictures for the time.</p>

<p>Oh, so anyway, high school me thought he'd be all smart and backup his best projects on the "floppy disks", despite whatever we
used to call the cloud being a good option, and CDs existing, which are covered in error checks and invulnrable to most forms of radiation
and electromagnetic impulses and still readable today. Half these floppies just died taking my art and games with them. Then finally, 
one of these "floppies" developed an STD. It not only died, but broke any floppy reader I stuck it into. These readers went on to destroy
any floppy inserted into them, eventually destroying all my data and alot of computer's floppy disk readers.

So that's why only a few of my magnificint projects from highschool and even early college remain :-( The more I try to remember them
the more gloriously I imagine them (though in reality most were grossly violent using images that today are microscopic. I've no motivation
to recreate the artwork, and in reality, any computer code I lost, I could easily recreate, much better in a tenth of the time it took to write
originally.
