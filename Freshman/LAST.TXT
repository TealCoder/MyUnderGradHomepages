Communication Skills and Teamwork


As a freshman at UOP, I am planing to gain as much communication skills as possible.  
So far, I could only gain communication skills from :
- Calculus 2 group work. 
- Mentor seminar 1 discussions. 
- Engineering 5 group works. 
- Working with groups on my Comp53 project.



 
      During last semester and this semester, my communication and teamwork skills have improved so much. I learned how to participate effectively in groups as a member, show up in a group meeting appointment at time, communicate with other members of my group, share ideas and discuss a project or  homework, and be responsible of my part of the group work. I learned and practiced to give a presentation about a specific topic, to stand in the class and talk using posters or power point slide shows.
 
     As a written communicator, I started learning and writing progress and formal reports for my introduction to engineering class. For example, my formal report preparation skills has improved so much when I worked with a groups of students on a formal report for a cardboard boat project. Also, I worked on a formal presentation for my introduction to engineering class, representing a team project of  Parabolic Food Aid Delivery System. For my Mentor Seminar class, I worked with a group of 5 students on a presentation about a T.V. show. All of these skills are helping me to prepare myself to be a successful engineering student.


    Professional and Personal Growth

         
 Personally, I am a member of a small family. I have one older brother and two sisters. My older brother is doing his masters degree in civil engineering. My family live in a nice big house,villa ,  in Mishref City in Kuwait, which is 5 minutes driving away from the sea. For more information about myself, my life, my country or my favorites, please visit the personal section, located at the bottom of the main page.
 
    Originally, I am from Kuwait, located in the Arabian Gulf next to Saudi Arabia. During my years in the mid school and high school, I tired to improve myself and my life. I had courses in computer and English language. After my graduation from Saleh Shehab High  School with a 4.00 GPA, I gained a scholarship from the Ministry of Higher Education in Kuwait to complete my undergraduate  studies in the United States . I went to the University of  Kansas in Lawrence , Kansas state. I stayed there for the fall semester  and  took 16 units of English classes to improve my  language. Thereafter, I came to the University of the Pacific and enrolled as a  freshman student majoring in Engineering Physics.The  first half of my freshman year has been a tremendous learning experience for me.  I felt very independent since I live here alone without  my parents. I learned how to manage my time as well as everything in my life. As a college student, I am changing as my skills and my life style are changing. As an engineering student, my life and time management are improving. My recent goal is to to obtain a bachelor in engineering physics and to improve my english as much as possible. In the future, I am intending to get a Ph.D. in engineering physics or electrical engineering and work in a large technology company.
